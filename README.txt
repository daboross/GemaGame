This project (GemaGame) is basically a Java Applet Game that I am making to futher my programming skills. It will change rapidly, probably.
You can use w/s/a/d to move, and up/left/right/down to shoot.
It randomly generates platforms as well.
You can try out the Applt HERE: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/36883456/run.html
That may not be the most recent version though :P.
