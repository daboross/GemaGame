This project (GemaGame) is basically a Java Applet Game that I am making to futher my programming skills. It will change rapidly, probably.
You can use w/s/a/d to move, and up/left/right/down to shoot.
It randomly generates platforms as well. Currently I have it set to generate them in a fixed pattern, but it *can* generate the randomly if I impliment my old code
You can try out the Applt HERE: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/36883456/GemaGame.html
Or by downloading the .html file in the source, and opening it :P.
That may not be the most recent version though :P.
