Level Help File
The syntax for a platform is as follows.
xPos yPos xLength yLength
This would add a platform that has the properties xPos:30 yPos:2 xLength:100 yLength:50
30 2 100 50

The program will treat anything that is not a number as a divider(Letters, spaces, and any non-number symbols are dividers). Multiple dividers will be considered as one. 
Any lines that are not comments and do not have 4 divided numbers will fail to load that line. Other lines will load if one line fails.

These are some valid entries:

23 48 56 78
