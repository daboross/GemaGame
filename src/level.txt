#Sample Level File
#The Level Getter will ignore any lines that start with #
#The syntax for a platform is as follows.
#;xPos;;yPos;;xLength;;yLength;;
#
#You should have nothing in the line except for numbers and ;s
#This would add a platform that has the properties xPos:30 yPos:2 xLength:100 yLength:50
#;30;2;100;50
#Do not include any lines that are not starting with either ; or #.
#even blank lines.
#And in lines that are not comments, do not use anything except numbers and ;. do not use spaces.
;0;;100;;30;;30;
